Merr Kayu Manis Restaurant,Rachma Fitriani,5.0,"Various food choices, some are best and well known Surabaya's delicacy. Food taste also kinda good (satay, rujak cingur both are good. Soto also good. Mie ayam and nasi madura taste just okay. Es campur also okay, but they serve it on a plate not a bowl like any other es campur we've known. Or idk maybe the style is different nowadays? Btw that's only my personal opinion tho, can be different with anyone. No hate.) Eating area kinda spacious, it's nice and clean. Parking area also spacious. Only slight minus here is they took sometime to serve your food, it will be very nice if they can prepare the food faster."

Botanika Restaurant,Ariella Cahya,4.0,"Modern Indonesian restaurant with a relaxed, casual setting, where you can find many different styles of Indonesian food from across the archipelago. Menu is fairly extensive with options of both one-dish meal and sharing plates for communal dining. Frankly speaking, the food did little to elevate my dining experience. In other words, it’s just okay-ish, except the fried tofu which earned 10/10 from me. Staffs were friendly, though the service could be slow during busy hours."
Botanika Restaurant,Inne Hadiati,4.0,"One recommended restaurant in Surabaya for Indonesian cuisine. The restaurant is spacious and has a parking lot which is very important in Surabaya.

Botanika Restaurant,Yani Rachma,5.0,"a well-known restaurant to enjoy indonesian cuisine. the place has an indoor tropical garden ambiance yet brings modern and minimalist concept. it’s very spacious and the cleanliness is excellent, even the toilets. nice place to have traditional meals and relax from surabaya crowds. most of meals in the menu tasted very good! here are the list of what we ordered: lidah asin cabai hijau 9/10 😍 ayam rica 9/10 (super soft texture!) 🤤 sop buntut bumbu basa 8.5/10 (quite refreshing) sate lilit ayam 9/10 ⭐️ selada mangga bakwan jagung 7/10"
Botanika Restaurant,Dapot Gultom,3.0,"The ambience invites us to chill while having delicious Indonesian traditional culinary experience. Ordered gado-gado gulung, mie aceh, nasi goreng kids meal, ayam tangkep aceh, and es buah naga. All tasted fine. A bit disappointed that we found a hair on the first roll of the gado-gado gulung but the staff responded well upon our complaint. They brought us a new set of the dish."
Botanika Restaurant,Alvin Rozaan,4.0,"Came for family dinner by making a reservation beforehand. We came around 5 PM and it's still pretty empty so we can still ask to change our table to our preferred location. Now for the details of our visit Place: located right on the side of main road so it is easy to spot and access. The inside is spacious and perfect for family or team dinner, there are indoor and outdoor space also 2nd floor even if it's not as big as the first floor. Food: Try their lidah sapi (cow tongue) and rendang, both are so tender especially for the tongue. Their rice set menu is kinda meh even though you can try variety of sides and menu. For the drink, i recommend their es campur durian. Service: now this is the downside, as when we just came and the place not too crowded they still can manage to assist swiftly. But after it get a bit crowded, we need to ask 2 different staff just for tissue as it took long time. And when we ordered extra menu including 2 plate of white rice, but it took really long which they can serve those rices first at least, but they wait for our other menu to be ready too before serve it Price: On the expensive side but it's worth with their taste and space I hope they can make improvement in their service side especially their serving time and customer assistance, as they have a good space and great food"
Botanika Restaurant,Piere Bertus,5.0,Very pleasant experience. Order taken and delivered with zero mistake.

With spacious parking area, 2nd storey huge dining area with an outdoor space too, plenty of tables, high chairs and wifi service, makes this place suitable for family or friends in big group. Food was delightfully served, nice, clean and taste was also not bad. What I like about this place is they have a visible kitchen from a transparant tempered glass. Secondly, they have a pretty good service. Fast, efficient, knowledgable, and gave condiments for each table. I got poffertjis (mini Indonesian pancake), and jelly for the kid. Unfortunately, thr portion is not as big compare to the premium quality and price. It could be very full on the weekend, so better to make a reservation before."

Restoran Sederhana Masakan Padang,Div Naritha,5.0,"(Translated by Google) Simple restaurant Simple is an Indonesian franchise company engaged in catering or food services with the typical Padang cuisine that I know from (Wikipedia). I always loved the Padang food especially if the side dish of Rujak spice likes how much the marinade is. My family and I decided to eat at the simple Padang restaurant on Jalan Kertajaya. For taste it can be said to be tasty even though sometimes it feels salty. In my opinion, to increase the visitors, try not to change the taste. LOCATION For its location it is very strategic. Can be seen from the big road Parking Pretty good can accommodate 20 cars and a little tight. For those of you who are culinary lovers, I recommend this place, you will not be disappointed with the food menu. (Original) Rumah makan Sederhana Sederhana adalah perusahaan waralabaIndonesia yang bergerak di bidang jasa boga atau makanan dengan ciri khas masakan Padang itu yang aku tau dari (Wikipedia). Dari dulu aku suka banget sama makanan padang apalagi kalau lauknya ayam bumbu rujak suka bgt kalo bumbunya banyak. Aku dan sekeluarga memutuskan buat makan di restoran padang sederhana di jalan kertajaya. Untuk rasa bisa dibilang enak meski kadang - kadang terasa asin. Menurutku, untuk meningkatkan para pengunjung, di usahakan cita rasa nya jangan sampai berubah. LOKASI Untuk lokasinya memang sangat strategis.bisa di lihat dari jalan besar Parkirannya Lumayan bisa menampung 20 mobil dan sedikit mepet . Bagi anda pencinta kuliner, aku rekom tempat ini kalian pasti ngk kecewa dengan menu makanannya."

I thought it would be prawn fried shrimp but it was actually shrimp and pete potatoes ... Padang rice is famous for its abundant spices and seasonings, but simple DARMAWANGSA is very very stingy seasoning .. time to eat like eating white rice with side dishes and a little sauce .. no taste of herbs and spices are not very abundant. price does not match the taste, more delicious eating in the side of the road 2. Order Martabak Egypt 34,100 very disappointed it tastes like egg given leeks and meat ... not even meat, but I found a piece of lung .. it's better to eat Martabak than other brands ... super duper very disappointed with the simple branch of Darmawangsa .. very different taste with a delicious kertajaya branch ..
